```admonish warning
**Ragu is under heavy development and has not undergone auditing**. Do not use this software in production.
```

**Ragu** is a Rust-language
[proof-carrying data (PCD)](concepts/pcd.md) framework that implements a
modified version of the
[ECDLP](protocol/prelim/assumptions.md#ecdlp)-based recursive SNARK
construction from [Halo [BGH19]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1021). Ragu
does not require a trusted setup. Developed for
[Project Tachyon](https://tachyon.z.cash/) and compatible with the
[Pasta curves](https://electriccoin.co/blog/the-pasta-curves-for-halo-2-and-beyond/)
employed in [Zcash](https://z.cash/), Ragu targets performance and
feature support that is competitive with other ECC-based
[accumulation](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/499) and
[folding](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/370) schemes without complicated
circuit arithmetizations.

* This book documents [working with Ragu](guide/getting_started.md), the
  [protocol's design](protocol/index.md), and
  [implementation details](implementation/arch.md) for those contributing to
  Ragu's development.
* The official Ragu source code repository is
  [available on GitHub](https://github.com/tachyon-zcash/ragu).
* [Crate documentation](https://docs.rs/ragu) is available for official Ragu
  crate releases.
* [Internal documentation](https://tachyon.z.cash/ragu/internal/ragu/) is
  available for Ragu developers, including private APIs and implementation
  details. It is continually rendered from the
  [`main`](https://github.com/tachyon-zcash/ragu/tree/main) branch and may
  include changes not yet in official releases.
* This book's
  [source files](https://github.com/tachyon-zcash/ragu/tree/main/book) are
  maintained within the Ragu repository.
