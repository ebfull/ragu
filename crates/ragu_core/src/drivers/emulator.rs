//! Emulation for executing circuit synthesis code without unnecessary
//! constraint enforcement or wire tracking.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! This module provides the [`Emulator`] driver, which can be used to execute
//! circuit synthesis code _directly_ rather than for assembling a witness or
//! polynomial reductions.
//!
//! There are three primary ways to use an [`Emulator`]:
//!
//! * [`Emulator::wireless()`] creates an [`Emulator`] that does not track wire
//!   assignments, but may or may not have a witness depending on the
//!   parameterized [`MaybeKind`]. This is used whenever we know wire
//!   assignments are not needed, but circuit synthesis code may need to be
//!   executed over a witness depending on the context, such as _within_ the
//!   execution of a generic driver.
//! * [`Emulator::execute()`] is a special case of [`Emulator::wireless()`] that
//!   _always_ has a witness. This is used for executing computations written as
//!   circuit synthesis code; the interstitial wire assignments don't matter, so
//!   we don't need to compute or track them.
//! * [`Emulator::extractor()`] is an emulator that always has both a wire
//!   assignment and a witness. This is used for extracting the wire values, for
//!   example using [`Emulator::wires()`].
//!
//! More generally, the [`Emulator`] runs in two modes: [`Wired`] and
//! [`Wireless`]. The three ways of using [`Emulator`] discussed above are just
//! shorthand for specific parameterizations of these modes.
